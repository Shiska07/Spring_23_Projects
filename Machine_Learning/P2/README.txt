files:
1) data.txt : larger dataset from homework 1 containing 120 datapoints.
2) P2_Ensemble_Classifiers-Bagging.ipynb : Jupyter notebook containing solutions for 1)
3) P2_Ensemble_Classifiers-Boosting.ipynb : Jupyter notebook containing solutions for 2)
4) P2_K_Means_Clustering.ipynb : Jupyter notebook containing solutions for 3)

Note:
- Custom implementation of softmax regression from project 1 was used for question 1 and 2 of this assignment.
- Most of the helper functions were also reused from previous projects/homeworks for the class.
- The datapoints in training and test files are of the following format: ((x1, x2, .....xn), y) 
- The notebooks do not prompt the user for any input. File 'data.txt' is automatically read and processed.
