ipython notebooks:
1) linear_regression.ipynnb : Linear regression implemented using numpy. The datapoints in training and test files are of the following format:
((x1, x2, .....xn), y)

2) locally_weighted_linear_regression.ipynb: Locally Weighted Linear regression implemented using numpy.The datapoints in training and test files are of the following format:
((x1, x2, .....xn), y)

3) softmax_regression.ipynb: Softmax regression for multi-class classification implemented using numpy and pandas. The notebook also allows the user to input custom filenames for part 3 a) after running all the cells.
