files:
1) data.txt : larger dataset from homework 1 containing 120 datapoints.
2) Ensemble_Classifiers-Bagging.ipynb : Jupyter notebook containing implementation of bagging for softmax regression models to reduce variation without increasing bias.
3) Ensemble_Classifiers-Boosting.ipynb : Jupyter notebook containing implementation of boosting for softmax regression models to improve both bias and variance.
4) K_Means_Clustering.ipynb : Jupyter notebook containing implementation of K Means Clustering from scratch.

Note:
- The datapoints in training and test files are of the following format: ((x1, x2, .....xn), y) 
- The notebooks do not prompt the user for any input. File 'data.txt' is automatically read and processed.
