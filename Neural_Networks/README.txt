This folder contains Neural Network Projects implemented: 

i) from scratch using NumPy: To understand the mathematics behind the architecture, forwards pass and how a network learns, a simple multi-layer neural network has been implemented using NumPy and the standard python math library.

ii) low level tensorflow APIs: Tensorflow low level APIs allow the user for a lot of flexibility regarding network architecture and the overall learning algorithm for the network.
 
iii) keras high level API: Keras high level APIs are easy to use and provide a lot of functionslity and pre-defined network layers and modules.
