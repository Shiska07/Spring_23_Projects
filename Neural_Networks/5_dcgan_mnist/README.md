This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) object using Keras and Tensorflow. All parameters have been hard-coded to train the models on the mnist hand-written digits dataset. 

- The goal is to understand the working mechanism of GANs in general and the arcitecture and functionality of the DCGAN object in Keras.
