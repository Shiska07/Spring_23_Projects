This project implements a flexible Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) object with modules for adding layers, setting weights and biases, removing a layer, etc. It also allows the user to load an existing keras model architecture and fine-tune it by adding/removing layers or changing weights.

- The goal is to understand the overall architecture and functionality of the Keras/Tensorflow model and layers object so that pre-existing models can be loaded and easily edited without having to build or train from scratch.
